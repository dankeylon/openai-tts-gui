# openai-tts-gui

** Currently in Early Development. Use at your own risk.

### Purpose:
Provides a GUI to interface with OpenAI's TTS api.

### Requirements
- openai python library
- pydub python library
- joblib python library
- dotenv python library

## Usage:
Before starting, provide a `.env` file and place it in the same folder as `audioBookify.py`.
This file should contain the following text:

```
OPEN_AI_KEY=<YOUR-OPEN-AI-KEY>
```

You must substitute an api key provided by OpenAI.  Using the api will cost you money.
